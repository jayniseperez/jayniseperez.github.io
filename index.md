I’m a Ph.D. candidate in the Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering and Earth Sciences at the University of Notre Dame. My graduate research is in atmospheric and upper ocean dynamics - from planetary waves to air-sea interactions - regarding the South Asian Summer Monsoon.

During my graduate career, I had the opportunity to be part of the Monsoon Intraseasonal Oscillations in the Bay of Bengal (MISO-BOB) field expeditions both in 2018 onboard the Tommy Thompson and 2019 on the Sally Ride, overseeing a set of atmospheric profiles from daily radiosonde deployments and assisting on the collection of ocean data from multiple instruments like CTD and VMP.

Borth and raised on the beautiful West coasts of Puerto Rico, my interest in environmental fluid dynamics began while pursuing my bachelor’s degree is in theoretical physics from the University of Puerto Rico, Mayagüez campus. Here, I worked as a research assistant for the regional association of the integrated ocean observing system - CariCOOS, validating a regional atmospheric model using the weather, research, and forecasting (WRF) system.

Throughout my doctoral career, partially funded by the Kinesis fellowship, I continuously shared my research at conferences like the American Geophysical Union and the American Meteorological Society. In addition to expanding my academic experience by partaking in a 2019 class on JPL’s NASA summer school on satellite observations and climate models and interning at the Atmospheric and Ocean Sciences (CAOS) in the Indian Institute of Science.

Aside from my academic work, I strive to promote graduate careers to students from underrepresented groups by helping them find a sense of belonging and confidence in achieving their academic goals through organizations like the Society of Women Engineers (SWE), the Latine Graduate Association at Notre Dame (LGAND) and local community organizations.
