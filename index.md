I'm a Ph.D. candidate in the department of Civil and Environmental Engineering
and Earth Sciences at the University of Notre Dame. My interests include atmosphere and upper
ocean dynamics; specifically, those regarding the South Asian Summer Monsoon. I took part in the
Monsoon Intraseasonal Oscillations in the Bay of Bengal (MISO-BOB) field expeditions both in 2018
onboard the Tommy Thompson and 2019 on the Sally Ride, overseeing a set of atmospheric
profiles from daily radiosonde deployments and assisting on the collection of ocean data from multiple
instruments like CTD and VMP. 

Her current paper focuses on the effects of multiscale interactions in
atmospheric variability that is observed from the collected data from the 2019 field experiment. She also
combines the use of satellite and model datasets into her research to study the different dominant modes
of variability, from both ocean and atmosphere, that exist withing and between the monsoon seasons.
Jaynise holds a bachelor’s degree in theoretical physics from the University of Puerto Rico,
Mayagüez campus where she worked as a research assistant during her last two years for the regional
association of the integrated ocean observing system CariCOOS. It was then where she stepped aside from
her previous research in quantum magnetism and began her academic journey in the realm of
environmental fluid dynamics by validating a regional atmospheric model using the weather, research and
forecasting (WRF) system. 

Throughout my doctoral career, partially funded by the Kinessis fellowship, I share my research in conferences like the American Geophysical Union and the 
American Meteorological Society. Additionally, Jaynise was part of the 2019 class on JPL’s NASA summer
school on satellite observations and climate models where she worked in the topic of tropical variability
and the analysis of El Niño Southern Oscillations (ENSO) forcing in observations and models. At the end of
that year, she was awarded research funding from the Indo-US Science and Technology Forum (IUSSTF).
She then worked together with Prof. Bhat at the Center for Atmospheric and Ocean Sciences (CAOS) in
the Indian Institute of Science, where she processed and analyzed atmospheric profiles from the Indian
Meteorological Society (IMD) as well as the field data from the field expeditions.
Aside from her academic work, one of her interests is promoting graduate careers to students
from underrepresented groups by helping them find a sense of belonging and confidence in achieving
their academic goals. She does this though organizations like the Society of Women Engineers (SWE), the
Latine Graduate Association at Notre Dame (LGAND) and local community organizations.
